# pgxscan
Struct scanning for pgx.

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/guidog/pgxscan.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/guidog/pgxscan)

This package adds simple scanning into structs using query results from pgx.
Therefore it is bound to pgx and Postgresql.
That's what it is meant for.
